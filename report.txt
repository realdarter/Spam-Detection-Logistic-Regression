1. What is the train set Accuracy as printed by your code?
Accuracy: 0.9560538116591928

2. What are the train set Precision, Recall and F1-measure (also called F1-score) of the positive (spam) class as printed by your code?

3. What are the train set Precision, Recall and F1-measure (also called F1-score) of the negative (ham) class as printed by your code?

4. What is the confusion matrix for the train set as printed by your code?
5. What is the test set Accuracy as printed by your code?
6. What are the test set Precision, Recall and F1-measure (also called F1-score) of the positive and the negative class as printed by your code?
7. What is the confusion matrix for the test set as printed by your code?

Draw a plot of log loss of the training data (y-axis) versus training iteration (x-axis), and include it in your report. You don’t need to include the code for generating the plot. What is the total cost of your model? Use the below formulas (ignore b parameter (bias)):

9. Count the number of positive and negative instances in your train file (you don’t need to report them). Keeping those counts in mind, what can you do to improve performance of your classifier on this corpus (apart from what you are already required to do in this homework)?
